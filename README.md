# hello-world
This is my new hello-world repository. If you are here, you have to be incredibly bored. Don't feel bad. We all get bored sometimes. But, the web is too wide to be complacent with surfing through random Readme files on Github. You can take your idleness to the next level! 

Here are a few suggestions on time-sucking things that you could be doing:
1) Learn how to use Photoshop. You wouldn't believe how many things can be forged when you know a bit of Photoshop.
2) Learn about government conspiracies. A good start would be "Loose Change" which you can watch for free on Youtube (Warning... it doesn't end here. You are really committing to wasting time on the internet for the next 20 years).
3) Watch "fail" videos on Youtube. 

There ya go. Now go out there and get to wastin' time!
